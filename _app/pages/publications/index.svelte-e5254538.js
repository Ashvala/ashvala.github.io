It features sound recommendations based on acoustic similarity and co-usage with a user's current sound selection in order to encourage exploration of the library. However, students have reported that the recommended sounds do not complement their current projects in terms of two areas: musical key and rhythm. We aim to improve the relevance of these recommendations through the inclusion of these two musically related features. This paper describes the addition of key signature and beat extraction to the EarSketch sound recommendation model in order to improve the musical compatibility of the recommendations with the sounds in a user\u2019s project. Additionally, we present an analysis of the effects of these new recommendation strategies on user exploration and usage of the recommended sounds. The results of this analysis suggest that the addition of explicitly musically-relevant attributes increases the coverage of the sound library among sound recommendations as well as the sounds selected by users. It reflects the importance of including multiple musical attributes when building recommendation systems for creative and open-ended musical systems.",bibtex:`@inproceedings{smith2023impact,

However, the state-of-the-art is very difficult to quantify; different studies often use different evaluation methodologies and different metrics when reporting results, making a direct comparison to other systems difficult if not impossible. Furthermore, the perceptual relevance and meaning of the reported metrics in most cases unknown, prohibiting any conclusive insights with respect to practical usability and audio quality. This paper presents a study that investigates state-of-the-art approaches side-by-side with (i) a set of previously proposed objective metrics for audio reconstruction, and with (ii) a listening study. The results indicate that currently used objective metrics are insufficient to describe the perceptual quality of current systems.",bibtex:`@inproceedings{vinay2022evaluating,

We use a publicly available dataset containing ten contemporary songs and concurrently recorded EEG. We generate a sequence of onset labels for the songs in our dataset and trained neural networks (a fully connected network (FCN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN)) to parse one second windows of input EEG to predict one second windows of onsets in the audio. We compare our RNN network to both the standard spectral-flux based novelty function and the FCN. We find that our RNN was able to produce results that reflected its ability to generalize better than the other methods.Since there are no pre-existing works on this topic, the numbers presented in this paper may serve as useful benchmarks for future approaches to this research problem.",bibtex:`@inproceedings{vinay2021mind,
