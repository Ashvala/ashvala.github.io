This project was built for [Ati Motors](https://www.atimotors.com). It is a tool that allows them to read their internal LIDAR file formats to a high performance renderer that uses Metal and Swift. This tool was primarily designed to be useful for the engineers and researchers at Ati to explore their data and build algorithms for their autonomous vehicles. The tool was written with Swift and Metal largely because researchers at Ati used macOS and Metal provides a way to write high-performance graphics renderers.
